<strong>Descrição:</strong> Scientific high-performance computing has supported numerous advances in several areas of human knowledge in the last two decades.During this period, most organizations including government bodies, research institutions and companies have intensified the production and analysis of large data volumes on an unprecedented way. The volume and variety of data have increased much faster than the available capacity of computers in the same period. Such disparity between the demand for information processing and the computational capacity has pushed the advances in scientific computing and high-performance computing. This proposal aims at improving the scientific high performance computing in four main research topics: (i) information retireval and query processing using massive parallel computing; (ii) high performance novelty detecion and malware analytics in data streams for cibersecirity; (iii) cloud computing for the scalable and efficient genome assembly and sequence alignment; (iv) scalability analysis of bag-of-tasks applications in heterogeneous computing platforms..
